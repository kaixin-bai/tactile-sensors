Example usagee:

./DSA-Konqueror ../pressure_profiles/grasps/teapot_handle.dsa 


In order to run a classification task, the SVM has to be trained. (Machine dependent file format)

cd ../python/classification
python train_classifier.py

Note: This might take some time (~10 minutes for the 856 pressure profiles)
