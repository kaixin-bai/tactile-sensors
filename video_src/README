# How to create videos of pressure profiles
# At least that's how I did it

# In DSA-Konqueror:
# NumBlock 0-5 sets camera to corresponding sensor matrix.
# File -> Export frames(s) as PNG.
# Take screenshots at a high resolution, e.g. 2304 x 2304 (= 3*768) to compensate for missing anti-aliasing filter.

# Convention: Add identifier "_matrix_n_" to filename, e.g. replace "_frame_" with "_matrix_1_"
rename -n 's/_frame_/_matrix_1_/' animation/*.png

# Resize and rotate frames and remove black background, i.e. add transparency.
./resize_and_rotate.sh animation/

# Extract sequence number and rename file since ffmpeg is picky with sequence filenames (max 5 digits, start_number option)
./renaming_sequence.sh animation/

# Convert camera video output to 1080p, 30fps if necessary.
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -s:v 1920x1080 -c:v libx264 -profile:v high -crf 18 -pix_fmt yuv420p -r 30 output.mp4

# Import video as well as transparent PNGs in Kdenlive (Add clip -> Sequence) and combine tracks with composite effect
# In case of frame rates != 30, drop frames in sequence (drop_frames.py)

# As an alternative, create a standalone video using "create_video.sh" and "create_video_loop.sh"
# For a green screen overlay effect in your project, chose
